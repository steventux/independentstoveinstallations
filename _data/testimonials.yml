      I wanted to get the best job at the best price and this is exactly what I got when I purchase my stove separately and got Dylan and Nick to install. They take pride in their work and rightly so because it is good quality work.

      It was Dylan I contacted in the first instance (since his number is listed first) and his knowledge was invaluable for getting the area ready for the stove installation. On the day they came bright and early, worked hard, did the job and left the area tidy. They then showed me how to operate the stove and explained the breaking in process for my particular brand of stove, something in all my research I had not heard about (but sure enough it was there if you knew what to look for). The icing on the cake was when showed me the rain cowl installed which they had done without any damage or alterations to my rather nice period chimney pot, something other installers had threatened to replace or damage in order to fit the cowl.

      I would happily recommend these guys to anyone. Professional, knowledgeable tradesmen at their finest.

      As a single Mum I’m always a little wary about having strangers in my home but I felt very relaxed as soon as I met Dylan. His quote was very competitive and his easy manner reassuring. Dylan and Nick as a team are punctual, professional, helpful and carry out their work to a very high standard. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone wishing to have a stove installed.

      I found Dylan & Nick on-line and am glad I did. Not only were they more competitive than the larger outfit that originally quoted, but they were better informed. On the advice of the previous firm I had already chosen and bought my stove before Dylan came out to assess the job. In retrospect, I wish I had waited till after I'd had a chat with Dylan and I would have saved myself money and both of us a lot of hassle.

      My installation was not straightforward based on the unit I'd bought and as a result, meant that they couldn't fit it on the 1st day, as the diameter of the flue liner required, wouldn't fit down my chimney! They both tried to solve the problem with various work arounds, but it just wasn't possible with the stove I'd bought.

      I had to change my stove and it meant they had had a wasted day. Despite this, Dylan and Nick rearranged to come back within a few days and completed the installation at no additional cost.

      General feedback is that they are very punctual (7.30am means 7.30); very knowledgeable, good standard of workmanship, good quality of materials that they supplied, reasonable price and they do exactly what they say on the tin!

      My overall learning and advice from this whole project is: to carefully check the size of the stove clearance (top, back and sides) and the diameter of flue pipe required with the installers before buying the stove (Please note: A "Defra" approved appliance, burns hotter and you can get away with a slimmer flue liner. Also if you want to burn wood in your wood burner in a smokeless zone you need a Defra appliance, so double check on your council website if you are in the smokeless zone!)

      PS: I'm not their friends and family and I have already paid them, so I can assure you this isn't in return for a discount! I genuinely recommend Dylan and Nick if you're serious about getting a stove installed.

      We chose Dylan and Nick after getting several quotes, as they seemed very knowledgeable, their quote was competitive and their advice was very useful. It was great to be able to select your own wood burner, which they then fitted as we didn't feel pressure to buy a particular brand. Dylan visited to assess the chimney and arranged dates for the lintel and plastering to be done and the wood burner to be fitted. On both dates they arrived on time and were very tidy, efficient and worked to a high standard. The third story chimney was problematic, which other companies might have given up on, but their experience and perseverance meant the stove was fitted as promised. I would highly recommend them to any one thinking of having a stove fitted.

      A friend recommended Dylan. He called to see my location and advised that I fit a Stovax Milner inset to avoid too much disruption.
      Together with Nick, they came at the appointed time and fitted the fire quickly and efficiently. I will certainly recommend them to anybody thinking of fitting a woodburner.

      After contacting Dylan, he came and gave us a price for installing the stove and another price for our fireplace alterations and plastering. On his website was a recommended stove supplier.

      We agreed a date for Dylan to do the work and he and his partner, Nick, came promptly on the morning as planned. Their work was very professional, clean and tidy. They explained all of the work that was to be carried out.

      Once the job was completed they tested the fire, gave advice on how to use it, and contact numbers for log suppliers and a chimney sweep for the future. We had a follow up call the next day to check that everything was OK.

      We would highly recommend Independent Stove Installations to our friends and family.

      Dylan was recommended to me by Andy at Firebox Stoves because I needed stoves to heat an old house but wasn't sure how many of the eight fireplaces we have were safe to use, or what would be best to install, and the fitters I'd contacted via websites weren't very helpful. Dylan visited and was awesomely knowledgeable and explained how to make the most of the four fireplaces that were viable and why the other fireplaces could not be used. It took a few months for me to make final decisions about the type of stoves to install, but without Dylan I would never have been able to make my mind up. It's so important to get expert advice about what will work best and what's involved with fitting the flues safely. Dylan was very methodical and thorough and has been on the end of the phone after fitting everything as well, because it took me a few months to totally get the hang of using the stoves.

      I am just writing to you to say a big thank I you for the fantastic job you did for my stove installation.
      From the moment I first called you through the final completion of work the service and quality of workmanship was outstanding.
      It wasn't the most straightforward installation, however you overcame all problems with ease and consulted me throughout the process which was very reassuring.

      I am a director of a local electrical contracting company and and I know the importance of respecting customers' home, it was great to see how you always cleaned up after yourself as you worked and always treated my home with the upmost respect.

      We were looking for someone to install a woodburner and found Nick and Dylan's details online. We decided to go with them after speaking with Dylan who was very helpful and knowledgeble when discussing the job by telephone. Dylan and Nick installed our woodburner, we found them thorough, professional and friendly. They took time to explain how to use and maintain our woodburner and gave us useful contacts for buying the woodburner, sweeping the chimney and wood delivery. They also raised our slate hearth (free of charge) which was something we hadn't managed to do ourselves. We would not hesitate in recommending Dylan and Nick to install your woodburner.
      Thanks again, we are looking forward to using it more!
      The stove looks brilliant and I am extremely grateful to both of you for the work you did. I would not hesitate to recommend you to other people who are thinking of having a stove installed in their home.
